            Audi AG is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria,
            Germany.
            The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century
            and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch (1868–1951).
            Established in 1909,
            The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder,
            August Horch. Horch, meaning "listen", becomes audi in Latin. Audi, along with German brands BMW and
            Mercedes-Benz,
            is among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world. Before World War II, Auto Union used the
            four interlinked rings
            that make up the Audi badge today, representing these four brands.
